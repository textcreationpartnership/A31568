            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>I Never did deſign, when firſt I ſet about theſe enſuing Miſcellanies to expoſe them to every Eye: For I truly judg'd, that having little other help than my Mother-Tongue to aſſiſt me therein, nothing worthy of a publick View could be produc'd
<pb facs="tcp:102314:4"/> by me. My only aim was to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſome few things for my pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Devotion, and that I might not trifle away too much of that time, which God hath given me, having no Calling to follow, nor Publick Concern to divert me.</p>
            <p>But contrary to this my firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, I have been prevail'd with (through the perſwaſion of an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Friend of mine, who had the peruſal of theſe when they were fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and who believed, they might be uſeful to promote holy deſires in the ſincere Chriſtian) to make them publick. I therefore deem it neceſſary to acquaint thee concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Hiſtory of our Saviour's Birth and Paſſion, (that thou may'ſt not expect more in it than I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended) that I never did deſign an exact Relation of all that is Recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded concerning him in the four E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts.
<pb facs="tcp:102314:4"/> My purpoſe was, only to Paraphraſe the two firſt Chapters of Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> and the ſeventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth Chapters of Saint <hi>John.</hi> With theſe when I had finiſh'd, (upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view) I thought convenient, where handſomely I could, to intermix ſome few material Paſſages out of the other Evangeliſts, to make the draught more full and clear.</p>
            <p>If what I have done ſhall prove an help to further any particular Perſon in his Devotion, or excite an abler Pen to undertake, and complete what here ſhall be found imperfect, I ſhall think my ſelf (with reſpect to my firſt intentions) more than ſufficiently recompenſed; and with patience ſhall endure the many Cenſures <hi>I</hi> am like to meet with from ſeveral perſons, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming (in an Age, in which Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb facs="tcp:102314:5"/> is arriv'd to that height of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as now it is) to bring on the publick Theatre a Muſe ſo mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly habited as mine. From the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Pious <hi>I</hi> queſtion not but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a gentle and charitable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction for this Action, and for my other ſort of Readers <hi>I</hi> value not their ſevereſt Cenſures.</p>

                           <l>He would have loath'd the moſt deplored ſight</l>

                           <l>But Jeſus, whoſe kind love doth over-flow,</l>
                           <l>And knows no bounds to us poor Souls below,</l>
                           <l>Dealt not, upon th' account of his Diſeaſe,</l>
                           <l>So with this man, as he would in this caſe,</l>
                           <l>But was ſo far from being inhumane,</l>

                           <l>Seeing his Faith and great humility,</l>

                           <l>Both touch'd him with his hand, &amp; likewiſe ſaid,</l>

                           <l>No ſooner had the ever-bleſſed Lord</l>

                           <l>That it the Lepers Skin immediately</l>
                           <l>Alter'd, and cleans'd him from his Leproſie.</l>
                           <l>The Leper cleanſed, Jeſus bid him tell</l>

                           </l>
                           <l>And <hi>Nepthali,</hi> which all men by the Name</l>
                           <l>Of <hi>Capernaum</hi> call, of noted Fame.</l>
                           <l>Hither the holy Jeſus often came,</l>
                           <l>Becauſe the place was populous, and ſo</l>
                           <l>Gave him occaſions oftentimes to do</l>
                           <l>Many ſtupend'ous Wonders, and thereby</l>
                           <l>Thoſe ſacred Truths he taught, to ratifie.</l>
                           <l>As he was entring now into this place,</l>
                           <l>It ſo fell out, that there a Captain was</l>
                           <l>Whoſe faithful Servant had for ſometime lain</l>
                           <l>Sick of a Palſie, in ſuch a horrid pain,</l>
                           <l>That he was paſt all humane art to ſave,</l>
                           <l>And now deſcending to the ſilent Grave.</l>
                           <l>At this much troubled the Centurion was,</l>
                           <l>And highly grieved for his Slave, becauſe</l>

                           <l>He dearly lov'd him, having found him juſt</l>

                           <l>Hearing therefore from ſundry Jews the Fame</l>
                           <l>Of Jeſus, who were once both Sick and Lame,</l>
                           <l>Whom he had healthful made, how happy he</l>
                           <l>Was in the curing any Malady,</l>
                           <l>That either was inflicted on the Mind,</l>

                           <l>Sent unto him the Elders of the Jews,</l>
                           <l>To beg him in their Names not to refuſe</l>
                           <l>To come, and heal his Servant who had prov'd</l>
                           <l>Faithful to him, and whom he dearly lov'd.</l>
                           <l>Not with the leaſt miſtruſt did he requeſt</l>
                           <l>This favour of them to the ever-bleſt,</l>
                           <l>Thinking that if he perſonally came,</l>
                           <l>Jeſus unto him would not grant the ſame:</l>
                           <l>But meerly out of great humility,</l>
                           <l>And a moſt wiſe and baſhful modeſty,</l>
                           <l>Knowing himſelf to be an Alien,</l>
                           <l>And then a Souldier, both which kind of Men</l>
                           <l>The Jews did for the greateſt part abhor,</l>
                           <l>As men of no Religion, thought therefore</l>
                           <l>Himſelf unworthy for to come, and crave</l>
                           <l>This favour of him for his faithful Slave.</l>
                           <l>And this the Elders of the Jews did know,</l>
                           <l>And therefore they, when begg'd by him to go</l>
                           <l>To Jeſus, with his humble ſuit to have</l>
                           <l>Some ſpeedy help for his poor dying Slave,</l>
                           <l>Went forthwith to him, and with earneſtneſs</l>
                           <l>The holy Jeſus for his Cure did preſs,</l>

                           <l>And that the perſon we intreat to have</l>
                           <l>Reſtor'd to health, is this ſame Souldier's Slave.</l>
                           <l>For lo the Captain, whom this man doth ſerve,</l>

                        <lg>
                           <l>When Jeſus heard the ſayings of theſe men;</l>
                           <l>To ſhew that he deſpis'd no man, how mean</l>

                           <l>That he could help and ſuccour to him give,</l>
                           <l>Went with the Elders of the Jews ſtraightway</l>
                           <l>Towards the houſe where the ſick Servant lay,</l>

                           <l>Some Friends of his the Captain did requeſt</l>

                           <l>So great a Favour as I ask of thee,</l>

                           <l>Thy Majeſty, to come thy ſelf and do.</l>
                           <l>Matters of ſmall importance I transfer</l>
                           <l>Unto thoſe Perſons, who my Servants are,</l>
                           <l>And bearing rule, with me they never ſtand</l>
                           <l>To argue, but obey my juſt command.</l>
                           <l>For if I ſay to one man go, he go'th,</l>
                           <l>And to another come, this thing he doth;</l>

                           <l>Under my Rule, as if I preſent were,</l>
                           <l>And did put all thoſe things which they have done</l>
                           <l>For me, my ſelf in Execution.</l>
                           <l>How much more ſhall thy Servants, Lord, fulfill</l>
                           <l>What thou injoyn'ſt, and do thy ſacred Will,</l>
                           <l>Although thou do'ſt not ſtir to ſee it done,</l>
                           <l>For ſuch thy power is, that there is none</l>

                        <l>Heaven and all its Joys above</l>
                        <l>Shall be the Object of my Love,</l>
                        <l>And ſtudy of my Life each day,</l>
                        <l>Till I my borrow'd Earth repay.</l>

                        <l>Strictly to keep this ſacred Vow.</l>
                        <l>Thou know'ſt what mighty Foes they are.</l>
                        <l>I muſt engage with in this War:</l>
                        <l>The World, on one hand, will be ſure</l>
                        <l>To bring its Glories to allure;</l>
                        <l>And its Temptations will combine</l>
                        <l>To ſhake this firm Reſolve of mine.</l>
                        <l>My Fleſh will all its vigour ſhow,</l>
                        <l>To make me to its Dictates bow.</l>
                        <l>And the induſtr'ous-wily-Fiend,</l>
                        <l>Againſt me all his Pow'rs will bend.</l>
                        <l>Forces too great to be withſtood,</l>

                        <l>Needs muſt I Faint, and be ſubdu'd,</l>

                        <l>Yet I am fully bent to try</l>
                        <l>Their Strength, and Fight them till I dye,</l>
                        <l>And do not doubt but at my Death,</l>
                        <l>To have the never-fading-Wreath.</l>
